# Stewart-Platform

The goal of this project is to create a 6 degrees of freedom stewart platform motion simulator for games like car race and flight sims.

Step 1 is to create a prototype of the motion simulator. Using servo motors, rods, HDPE sheets (High Density Polyethylene), arduino, etc, and a bit of wiring, the prototype below was built.
